# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 

## Overview  
This repository contains the data cleaning and preprocessing steps applied to the [Dataset Name] dataset from [source, e.g., Kaggle]. The aim was to clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  

## Files Included  
- `data_cleaning_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the data cleaning code.  
- `dataset.csv`: The raw dataset used for analysis (if applicable).  
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: The cleaned dataset resulting from the preprocessing steps.  
- `screenshots/`: (if applicable) Screenshots documenting part of the process.  

## Steps Taken  
1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded the dataset and explored its initial structure, including checking for missing values and data types.  
2. **Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values in the `Income` column by replacing them with the mean/median/mode.  
3. **Duplicates**: Removed any duplicate entries from the dataset.  
4. **Standardization**: Standardized text values and converted data formats as needed.  
5. **Data Types**: Checked and corrected data types for columns where necessary.  
6. **Result**: The final cleaned dataset is available as `cleaned_dataset.csv`.
